Find 00 C0 04 6C subtract 0x10, this appears to be the start of the model, it should read as 06 00 00 10

Find 08 C0 01 6C add 0x20 to find pointer to header below (08 C0 01 6C is sometimes +0x54 from the start of the model)

Header?: 09 C0 01 6C
Header+0x14: 0A C0 0B 6D
Header+0x70: 15 C0 09 6C
Header+0x104: 1E C0 09 6C (can sometimes be 04 01 00 01 ff ff nn 65 of the UV mapping. This appears to be for billboarded objects, like the flame above the safehouse in ep7)
Header+0x198: 04 01 00 01 ff ff nn 65 (UV Mapping, if above was 1E C0 09 6C. This is 27 C0 01 6D for an animated conveyor belt in ep7, adding 0xC to this gives the UV address)
-Level split into chunks
Per chunk: (ff is unknown, but maybe flags? nn = number of elements in the group)
	UV Mapping - 04 01 00 01 ff ff nn 65
		each UV is 4 bytes per vertex
	Vertex Data - ff ff nn 6C (always aligned to multiples of 0x10?)
		Vertecies are floats, vertex is X,Y,Z then 4 bytes of flags (vertex is 16 bytes total)
	Unknown? - 01 01 00 01 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ff ff nn 6C

	Unknown? - 00 00 00 00 ff ff nn 6C
